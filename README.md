# jest-puppeteer-sinon-poc

This POC is to create automated tests for the analytics using 
- Puppeteer
- Sinon
- Jest

## How to setup?
1. Clone and go to the directory
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn test` or `npm test`

### Pass the custom BASE_URL as - 
`npm test -- -u="http://google.com"`

#### NOTE - This is implemented only for the Hero component. So you need to have Hero component on the home page for the tests to work.
